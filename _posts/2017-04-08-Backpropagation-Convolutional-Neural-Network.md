title: Backpropagation for Convolutional Neural Network
---
This post briefly covers backpropagation for a convolutional neural network, derived in the context of work on the second assignment for the Winter 2016 iteration of the Stanford class [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html).
